| Nov 12 |  11:40am-12pm   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               I started writing my code for this problem set. I finished the first draft of my code, where I read in every char into the binary file as a two bit binary code (I use a for loop to go through the entire sequence string). Solving this problem feels pretty intuitive, however I'm currently having trouble running the program in the terminal. |

I continued to debug my code and I have gotten to the point where my code now prints out 3 extra 'A's when I run genomeTest. I am not sure why it does this, however I think it might have something to do with the close() call. |

I started trying to figure out how to fix this error, however I have tried multiple things and none have worked. I am kind of going in circles with the debugging at this point. |

I have been going in circles since I last logged, and I still am not any closer to figuring it out. I know that the 0s are being added on at the end as padding, however I can't think of a way to take them out, or show that the end of the file has been reached before. |
| Nov 13 | 10:05am-10:35am |                                                                                                                                                                                  I realised that I could write out the length of the file before inputting the binary values of the letters in the sequence. I got my code to work when I used the first 13 bits to write out the length of the sequence, which I then read in in my expand function to determine how many characters the file should read through before closing. I now don't run into the error where I write out the extra As. |
| Nov 14 |  9:30am-9:50am  | I tried to think of ways to improve my compression ratio (specifically in the smaller test case). I didn't come up with much, as I realized that I likely couldn't get much better than two bits per letter, and I also wasn't sure how I would approach the dynamic sizing of the header of the size. I thought about adding 4 bits or more to the header at the beginning to state how long the actual header was, but I realized that this wouldn't actually lead to better compression of the smaller test case (at least not significantly), as I would still have a header of similar size. |
