| Nov 12 |  11:40am-12pm   |                                                              I started writing my code for this problem set. I finished the first draft of my code, where I read in every char into the binary file as a two bit binary code (I use a for loop to go through the entire sequence string). Solving this problem feels pretty intuitive, however I'm currently having trouble running the program in the terminal. |
| Nov 12 |   7:15pm-8pm    |                                                                       I have learned how to run the terminal calls much better and was thereby able to start debugging my code. I continued to debug my code and I have gotten to the point where my code now prints out 3 extra 'A's when I run genomeTest. I am not sure why it does this, however I think it might have something to do with the close() call |
| Nov 12 |   8pm-8:30pm    |                                                       I have figured out that I am getting 3 extra 'A's because of the close() call leading to a call that fills in the remaining spaces with 0s to get to a multiple of 8 bits. I started trying to figure out how to fix this error, however I have tried multiple things and none have worked. I am kind of going in circles with the debugging at this point |
| Nov 12 |  8:30pm-9:15pm  |                                                 I am still trying to figure out how to keep the 'A's from being added on at the end. I have been going in circles since I last logged, and I still am not any closer to figuring it out. I know that the 0s are being added on at the end as padding, however I can't think of a way to take them out, or show that the end of the file has been reached before. |
| Nov 13 | 10:05am-10:35am | I realised that I could write out the length of the file before inputting the binary values of the letters in the sequence. I got my code to work when I used the first 13 bits to write out the length of the sequence, which I then read in in my expand function to determine how many characters the file should read through before closing. I now don't run into the error where I write out the extra As. |
